Hello, I've been engaging in this homework with a bit of struggle. I tried to run several kinds of script but I deleted them because they didn't work.
What I want to do is redo it and really spend all my time on it.

Sub Ticker_line()

  ' Set an initial variable for holding the Ticker;
  Dim Ticker As String
  
  ' Determine the last row;  
  LastRow = Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
  
  ' Keep track of the location for each Ticker in the summary table
  Dim Summary_Table_Row As Integer
  Summary_Table_Row = 2

  ' Loop through all Ticker
  For i = 2 To LastRow

    ' Check if we are still within the same Ticker, if it is not...
    If Cells(i + 1, 1).Value <> Cells(i, 1).Value Then

      ' Set the Brand name
      Ticker = Cells(i, 1).Value

      ' Print the Ticker in the Summary Table
      Range("I" & Summary_Table_Row).Value = Ticker

    

    End If

  Next i 

End Sub
